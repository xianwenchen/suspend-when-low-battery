#+title: The Design of swlb
#+author: Xianwen Chen

* Introduction

swlb is a shell script that calls zzz when battery level is low.
swlb means suspend when low battery.

The script is written for Void Linux.

The shell script was based on [[https://old.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/l03w0c/automatic_zzz_when_battery_is_lower_than_a/gjtung5/][u/GNU-Toxic]]'s shell script that answered [[https://old.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/l03w0c/automatic_zzz_when_battery_is_lower_than_a/][my question]].

The idea of running the shell script as a service was suggested by [[https://old.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/l03w0c/automatic_zzz_when_battery_is_lower_than_a/gjrq4ln/][u/ahesford]] when he or she answered the same question.

* The swlb Script

swlb starts with a shebang.

#+name: swlb-shebang
#+begin_src sh :exports codes :eval no
#!/bin/sh
#+end_src

Define the critical battery level as 15%.
lbl means low battery level.

Define the check interval to be 60 seconds.
ci means check interval.

#+name: swlb-var
#+begin_src sh :exports codes :eval no
lbl=15
ci=60
#+end_src

Check charging status.
If the battery is being discharged, check battery level.
If battery level is lower than $lbl, tell dmesg and suspend the computer.

When waking up, tell dmesg too.

#+name: swlb-loop
#+begin_src sh :exports codes :eval no
while true
do
    status=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status)
    if [ $status = Discharging ]; then
        capacity=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity)
        if [ $capacity -le $lbl ]; then
	    echo "$(date): Battery level is $capacity%. Going to suspend." > /dev/kmsg
            zzz
	    echo "$(date): Waking up." > /dev/kmsg
        fi
    fi
    sleep $ci
done
#+end_src

Put every piece together.
Tangle it to ../swlb.

#+name: swlb
#+begin_src sh :tangle ../swlb :exports codes :eval no :noweb yes
<<swlb-shebang>>

<<swlb-var>>

<<swlb-loop>>
#+end_src

../swlb needs to be executable.
The code below is executed, when this org document is exported, which sets ../swlb to be executable.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both
chmod +x ../swlb
#+END_SRC

* Service Script

** runit

I create a run file for the runit, which is used by Void Linux.

The content of the run.

#+name: swlb-run
#+begin_src sh :tangle ../init/runit/swlb/run :exports codes :eval no :noweb yes
#!/bin/sh
exec swlb
#+end_src

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both
chmod +x ../init/runit/swlb/run
#+END_SRC

* Potential Extension

If the script gets used by more people, the settings of critical battery level and check interval can be defined /etc/swlb.conf.
Right now I am the only user of this script.
I keep the settings in the script.

A service for systemd and/or other init systems can be written too, not only for Linux but other UNIX-like systems such as OpenBSD.

The command, zzz, can be replaced by commands for other systems, such as "system suspend" or "loginctl suspend" for Linux and "apm -z" for OpenBSD.
